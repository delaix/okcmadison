	<h1>Practical Karate</h1>
	<p>
	What is practical karate and why would anyone bother to invent such a term? One would not imagine that impractical karate would have a strong market appeal. Of course that is not really the distinction I am trying to draw. One needs to understand that the karate that burst from Japan after the war was significantly modified from its original source art from Okinawa. What started out as a no nonsense fighting method for self defense became a sport and a means of self improvement with a martial heritage. In the same way that the battlefield method of hand to hand combat jujitsu was tamed into the sport of judo, a rustic (to the Japanese anyway) fighting art was civilized. The connection with self defense became attenuated.

	<p>
	This change was not inherently a bad thing and I do not wish to criticize it. A fighting sport that can be practiced safely by adults and even children that offers the opportunity to compete with others or just develop oneself physically is certainly something that many people will see as a great benefit. Japanese karate-do has spread around the world so it is difficult to argue with its appeal. And, truthfully, had this change never occurred, the art of karate would probably have died out on Okinawa and been lost to us.
	</p>
	<p>
	Still, for some, a sporting art does not hold the same appeal. They need or want to learn a true fighting art to protect themselves and others or just prefer to connect with the old ways instead of a modern sport. Practical karate is the product of the revival of original karate that developed in Okinawa. The true fighting techniques, many of which would never be allowed in a sporting arena because they can cause serious and even permanent injury. The focus is on life protection in the face of a criminal, violent attack that could cause serious injury or death. Legally and morally, when attacked in this manner, a violent and even deadly response is justified to protect oneself from this level of harm. The goal is simply to as quickly as possible end the violent attack to preserve oneself.

	The old masters of Okinawa encoded their techniques and strategies into kata, the essence of Okinawan karate. The bunkai, the analysis and application of the kata was often closely held and only fully taught to the most trusted of students. Unfortunately, this secretiveness and the transmission of karate from Okinawa to Japan and to the world has broken the chain of this oral history. The kata survive but not completely the interpretation. Thankfully though the work of karate researchers like  <%= link_to "Iain Abernethy", "https://www.iainabernethy.co.uk" %>, <%= link_to "Patrick McCarthy", "http://www.koryu-uchinadi.com" %>, and others we can decode the kata and derive effective and credible methods of self defense. Practical karate is necessarily a reconstruction and interpretations can vary in specifics, but ultimately we can connect back to the roots of karate.

	And this, ultimately, is how to practice practical karate. We link directly self protection to kata. The practice of kata itself becomes more than mere exercise or abstract development of technique, but rather an active method of developing responses to violent attack. The moves are imbued with meaning and the karateka can imagine the attack and effectiveness of the response encoded in the kata. From the kata we derive the kumite and related drills which allow one to practice with partners to develop the sense of applying techniques on a real opponent. Kata, kumite, and self defence are integrated and self reinforcing producing a unified fighting art well suited to life preservation. This is the ultimate goal of practical karate.
